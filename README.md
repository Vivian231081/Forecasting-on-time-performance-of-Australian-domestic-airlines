# Forecasting-on-time-performance-of-Australian-domestic-airlines
 On-time performance is one of the most critical factors in determining airlines' customer service
 reliability and competitiveness in the Australian domestic aviation industry. A such, this project used
 datasets on the Australian Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) website
 to forecast the on-time performance of Australian domestic airlines in June 2024. In this study, ARIMA
 and VAR models are applied to predict three significant variables: On Time Departures rate (%), On
 Time Arrivals rate (%) and Cancellations rate (%).

- The Australian Airlinesâ€™ on-time performance in June 2024 will be slightly better than its performance in November 2023.
- The on-time departures rate and the on-time arrivals rate will still be significantly lower than the long-term average performance, which are 81.2% and 82.3%, respectively. The cancellation rate forecasted by the ARIMA model will be much higher than the long-time average of 2.2% while this rate forecasted by the VAR model is only 2.14%.
- In conclusion, it seems doubtful that the Australian domestic airlines will see a major improvement in their on-time performance in the next seven months.
